Locate files or folders in Solution Explorer
===

A plugin for ReSharper 8 that allows you to quickly lookup any file or folder in your solution, but without opening it.  
This allows for uninterrupted workflow of going to a particular location in the solution explorer (perhaps to add a new file),  
but without opening an arbitrary file in that location.

Invoked via **double Shift-Alt-L** - you will be presented with a dialog similar to Go to File:

![Locate file in Solution Explorer][1]

To download, simply install [**ReSharper.LocateFileInSolutionExplorer**](https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/ReSharper.LocateFileInSolutionExplorer) package from ReSharper's [Extension Gallery](http://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/).

ReSharper 8.1 or later required.
